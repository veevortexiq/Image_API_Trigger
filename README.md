# Image_API_Trigger

## Usage Instructions
### Open the File:
Use any modern web browser to open the index.html file. This will load the web page and prepare it for interaction.
### Trigger Workflow:
The page is designed to execute a workflow automatically upon loading. Ensure that any necessary scripts or dependencies are correctly linked within the HTML file.
## Customization:
To modify the workflow or add additional functionality, edit the index.html file using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE). Make sure to test changes in a browser to verify that they work as expected.
## Dependencies
Ensure that your browser supports HTML5 and JavaScript, as these are typically required for executing workflows within a web page.
## Troubleshooting
If the workflow does not trigger as expected, check for any console errors in your browser's developer tools.
Verify that all external resources (if any) are correctly linked and accessible.
